<p>
When you ask someone why they do what they do or why they want to do a particular thing, the response is commonly a simple one with what seems to be lack of forthought. Something like "It's what I love" or "It just feels right." People, including myself, seem to struggle with this question that seems like it should be an easy one to answer. My dad used to ask me, "Grant, what are you <i>passionate</i> about?". Not an easy question to answer.
</p>
<p>
For me, I think I find it difficult to answer because I never really picked my interest in teaching. In a way, it sort of fell into my lap when I was young.
</p>
<p>
My aspirations of becoming a teacher were not recognized as what they are until very recently but the more I think about it, the more I realize that it is what I've wanted since I was in gradeschool.
</p>
<p>
The intial seed that grew into my desire to become a teacher was my experiences at a YMCA summer camp as a young boy. It manifested itself as a desire to be just like my camp counselors (because <b>nobody</b> is cooler than your camp counselors when you are 8). I spent 8 summers or so with the mentality of wanting to be just like the camp staff. By then I was 16 and the table was turning-- I was now of age to be that counselor I previously looked up to. 
</p>
<p>
I worked at the camp for another four summers, which is when I slowly realized what I was doing and the role I was playing in the life of the kids I worked with. I regularly think about my time their and still discover new things about myself. By reflecting on my time there, I've concluded that what I was most passionate about wasn't all the superficial elements of the camp but rather the community itself and how it fosters such healthy and positive growth and the people who serve it. I think I am most passionate about being a role model and being a part of something bigger than myself, which I think is what teaching is all about.
</p>
<p>
The Flow in School article's (Shernoff <i>et al.</i>) regarding teacher 'flow' supports the idea of the importance of the teacher acting as a role model. If a student's liason to academia is someone who they have a positive relationship with and can look up to, they are considerably more likely to be engaged and interested in what they have to teach. On the contrary, if they have a poor relationship with their mentor, they probably won't be very interested in what knowledge they have to share. 
</p>

It makes me think back to highschool and think of all the teachers I didn't like and all the teachers I did like and how much I learned in their classrooms. Not to my surprise, there is a strong trend. My favorite teacher in highschool taught chemistry. What am I studying at the U? Chemistry, of course!
