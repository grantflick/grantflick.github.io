<p>
When you ask someone why they do what they do or why they want to do a particular thing, the response is commonly a simple one with what seems to be lack of forthought. Something like "It's what I love" or "It just feels right." People, including myself, seem to struggle with this question that seems like it should be an easy one to answer. My dad used to ask me, "Grant, what are you <i>passionate</i> about?". Not an easy question to answer.
</p>
<p>
For me, I think I find it difficult to answer because I never really picked my interest in teaching. In a way, it sort of fell into my lap when I was young.
</p>
<p>
My aspirations of becoming a teacher were not recognized as what they are until very recently but the more I think about it, the more I realize that it is what I've wanted since I was in gradeschool.
</p>
<p>
The intial seed that grew into my desire to become a teacher was my experiences at a YMCA summer camp as a young boy. It manifested itself as a desire to be just like my camp counselors (because <b>nobody</b> is cooler than your camp counselors when you are 8). I spent 8 summers or so with the mentality of wanting to be just like the camp staff. By then I was 16 and the table was turning-- I was now of age to be that counselor I previously looked up to. 
</p>
<p>
I worked at the camp for another four summers, which is when I slowly realized what I was doing and the role I was playing in the life of the kids I worked with. I regularly think about my time their and still discover new things about myself. By reflecting on my time there, I've concluded that what I was most passionate about wasn't all the superficial elements of the camp but rather the community itself and how it fosters such healthy and positive growth and the people who serve it. I think I am most passionate about being a role model and being a part of something bigger than myself, which I think is what teaching is all about.
</p>
<p>
The Flow in School article's (Shernoff <i>et al.</i>) regarding teacher 'flow' supports the idea of the importance of the teacher acting as a role model. If a student's liason to academia is someone who they have a positive relationship with and can look up to, they are considerably more likely to be engaged and interested in what they have to teach. On the contrary, if they have a poor relationship with their mentor, they probably won't be very interested in what knowledge they have to share. 
</p>
<p>
It makes me think back to highschool and think of all the teachers I didn't like and all the teachers I did like and how much I learned in their classrooms. Not to my surprise, there is a strong trend. My favorite teacher in highschool taught chemistry. What am I studying at the U? Chemistry, of course!

<h3><a name="Blog Assignment 1: Why teach? What Does it mean to teach?" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Blog Assignment 2: How has history shaped education today?</h3>
<p>
The relationship between history and education is a close one. Past events have been used as a basis for a great number of decisions made in regards to current education and education has equally shaped history yet to be written. 
</p>
<p>
Accoridng to the Race Forward website, the government has made education available through legislation since the earliest years of U.S. history and the basic structure of the modern public school system has been in place for more than one hundred years. 
</p>
<p>
In the last 20 years, the majority of legislative decisions shaping education have been surrounding political 'hot button issues', such as immigration, union labor, separation of church and state... The list goes on and it would be easy to delve into these and butt-heads, but someone important to me used to say "you can't apply logic to illogical things." 
</p>
<p>
In the case of public schools, the majority of decisions are made by the legislators elected by the population. For better or worse, the majority of people's thoughts and decisions regarding these topics are historically based. Often times, "because that's the way its always been" is not great justification for something. However, thats not to say that some decisions made long ago were not the right ones for then or now. Consider the current immigration situation in the United States-- a very polarized issue (as with most issues...when did it become not okay to be in the middle on something?). 
</p>
<p>
Historically, education legislation was implimented for the benefit of immigrants, enabling them to attend schools in the interest of the future of the country. However, recent efforts have been made to do the exact opposite, attempting to prevent undocumented residents the ability to attend school. Personally, I feel that the issue at hand is not regarding education but rather the documentation process. To disagree with providing education to the masses is a deliberate detriment to the future of the country and world.
